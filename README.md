Flappy Ghost solved with a genetic algorithm

Authors: Alexandra Colf and Andrea Minguez

This code corresponds with the creation of a Flappy Ghost game that is solved using a genetic algorithm. 

The game is called Flappy Ghost, as instead of a bird, it has a ghost, so it is easy to differentiate our game from the original game Flappy Bird.

To be able to see the difference between a human playing and the genetic algorithm, the game has three different modes, allowing the user to choose between him/her playing, the machine playing or watching the best play of the machine.
